# World Cup Data Analysis

## Repository Description:
This project involves analyzing World Cup data, focusing on the host countries, champions, and runners-up of each tournament. The goal is to explore trends and patterns using data analysis techniques with Python and visualization libraries.

## Project Overview:
This project evaluates the analytical skills of students by collecting, analyzing, and presenting data on World Cup championships. It includes data collection, statistical analysis, and visualizations created with Python's Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries. 

## Key Features:
1. **Data Collection**: The project gathers data on World Cup tournaments, including host countries, champions, and runners-up. Data is sourced from reliable platforms and structured into a tabular format for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: The dataset is analyzed using Python's Pandas and Numpy libraries. Key trends, patterns, and insights are identified, including the average year of the tournaments, the distribution of host countries, and champion trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Various visualizations (such as bar charts and line graphs) are created to illustrate key insights and trends in the data.
4. **Results**: Visual and textual representations of the analysis help to convey insights about World Cup history, including how often certain countries hosted or won the tournament.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Applying analytical thinking and statistical techniques to real-world data.
- Visualizing data to communicate trends and insights effectively.
- Understanding data cleaning, processing, and exploratory analysis.

## Data Sources:
- The dataset contains information on World Cup tournaments, sourced from public sources and structured to facilitate analysis. 

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Data Storage**: Excel
- **Development Environment**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the main script `analisis_datos.py` to load and process the data.
4. Visualizations are separated into individual Python files for ease of use.
